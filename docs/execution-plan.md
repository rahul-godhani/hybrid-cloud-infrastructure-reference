# Infrastructure Execution Plan

This document outlines a high-level, practical approach to executing
the hybrid cloud infrastructure design described in this repository.

It focuses on sequencing, dependencies, and operational readiness
rather than detailed implementation steps.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations

- Identify business and compliance requirements
- Define environment boundaries (prod, non-prod)
- Establish naming conventions and access policies
- Select core networking patterns

---

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

- Create base networking (VPC/VNet, subnets)
- Configure identity and access management
- Establish baseline security controls
- Enable logging and monitoring foundations

---

## Phase 3: Compute and Services

- Provision compute resources based on workload needs
- Configure storage and backup policies
- Validate network connectivity and access paths

---

## Phase 4: Reliability and Readiness

- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Validate backup and recovery processes
- Perform failure and recovery testing
- Document operational procedures

---

## Phase 5: Operational Handover

- Finalize documentation
- Define ownership and escalation paths
- Conduct knowledge transfer
- Establish ongoing maintenance processes
